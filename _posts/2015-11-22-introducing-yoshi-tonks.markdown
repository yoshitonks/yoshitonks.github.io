Someone once said that the internet is made of cats (source: http://rathergood.com/2015/09/09/the-internet-is-made-of-cats/). And we agree with them. It is fact, it is science - and it's also awesome. 

Because the internet is made of cats no one will probably notice a new blog set up to collect together a bunch of cool things that are made for those cats that make up the internet.  But it's here anyway.
